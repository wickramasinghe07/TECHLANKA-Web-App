Introduction

Online education has become a well-liked and successful learning approach as a result of the development of digital technology. The way that people acquire knowledge and skills has been transformed by online education platforms, which make tutorials easily accessible and let students ask questions about the subject matter.
The goal of the online education system is to give students a flexible and convenient learning environment. Learners can access tutorials at their convenience, which may comprise videos, presentations, documents, or other multimedia. These tutorials are often downloadable, enabling students to access them when they want, wherever they want, on any device, and at their own speed. The ability to access tutorials in a variety of ways gives students the freedom to choose their own learning paths and fit education into their hectic lives.

The possibility for students to ask questions about the lessons is one of the main aspects of the online education system. Learners can ask questions to get more information, get clarification on concepts, or get assistance with difficult subjects. By enabling learners to actively engage with the content, this feature encourages active engagement and involvement.

When using this system, users can log in by providing a legitimate username and password. A user can view the dashboard after logging into the system. Users can choose or look for a similar module and then proceed from there. On the website, teachers can register as well. After successfully registering, users have access to upload tutorials, quizzes, and lecture notes. Users have the option to complete tutorials or tests when the subsequent lectures begin. They can also upload any questions they may have. Other educational institutions do not keep an area for uploaded questions. All they watch are lectures on video. On this page, users can focus more on discussing any questions they may have. Additionally, the coordinators are well-versed in it.






Methodology

MERN
MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js are often referred to as MERN, and they are a group of open-source technologies used to create contemporary web applications. MERN is a full-stack JavaScript framework that addresses both the front and back ends of web application development.
MongoDB: A well-liked NoSQL database, MongoDB uses an adaptable, document-based approach to store data. It is renowned for its performance, scalability, and capacity for handling massive volumes of data. The database element of the MERN stack uses MongoDB.

Express is a Node.js online application framework that makes it easier to create web APIs and manage HTTP requests and responses. It offers a selection of features for creating reliable and expandable server-side JavaScript applications.

React: React is a well-liked JavaScript user interface construction library. It offers a component-based method for creating UI components, which makes it extremely efficient and modular. In the MERN stack, React is often used to create the front-end or user interface portion of web applications.
The MERN stack requires a number of processes to establish an educational system, including setting up the back-end server, developing the front-end user interface, and integrating them all. Here is a list of the main steps involved.
Construct the system: Specify the elements and capabilities you wish to see in your educational system. Plan out the structure of the system, considering the many sorts of data you'll be keeping, how you'll organize it, and how users will interact with it.

Create the back-end server using Node.js and Express to handle requests made by the front-end for API services. Create routes and controllers to handle various API endpoints, such as user administration, authentication, and data retrieval.

building the database, the database for holding educational data, such as users, courses, lessons, quizzes, and other pertinent information, should be created using MongoDB. Define the schemas and data models that will be used to organize the database's data.
Implement APIs: To handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions on the database, create APIs using Express. Define the API endpoints for managing various tasks, including establishing and managing courses, lessons, and tests as well as user accounts and user authentication and authorization.

Create the front-end user interface by utilizing React for your educational system. Create and build the elements that will be used to present classes, tests, and other educational materials. Create user interfaces for managing user accounts and registering new users. Connect to the back-end APIs to retrieve and show database data.
