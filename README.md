Introduction

Online education has become a well-liked and successful learning approach as a result of the development of digital technology. The way that people acquire knowledge and skills has been transformed by online education platforms, which make tutorials easily accessible and let students ask questions about the subject matter.
The goal of the online education system is to give students a flexible and convenient learning environment. Learners can access tutorials at their convenience, which may comprise videos, presentations, documents, or other multimedia. These tutorials are often downloadable, enabling students to access them when they want, wherever they want, on any device, and at their own speed. The ability to access tutorials in a variety of ways gives students the freedom to choose their own learning paths and fit education into their hectic lives.

The possibility for students to ask questions about the lessons is one of the main aspects of the online education system. Learners can ask questions to get more information, get clarification on concepts, or get assistance with difficult subjects. By enabling learners to actively engage with the content, this feature encourages active engagement and involvement.

When using this system, users can log in by providing a legitimate username and password. A user can view the dashboard after logging into the system. Users can choose or look for a similar module and then proceed from there. On the website, teachers can register as well. After successfully registering, users have access to upload tutorials, quizzes, and lecture notes. Users have the option to complete tutorials or tests when the subsequent lectures begin. They can also upload any questions they may have. Other educational institutions do not keep an area for uploaded questions. All they watch are lectures on video. On this page, users can focus more on discussing any questions they may have. Additionally, the coordinators are well-versed in it.
